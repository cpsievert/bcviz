## Some thoughts

The app should obviously have some drill-down capabilities, where users can see overall trends, then zoom-in to reveal detailed information for specific region(s). However, as Figure \@ref(fig:regions) shows, there are many types of regions!

```{r regions, fig.cap = "Different types of regions available for BC Stats data."}
knitr::include_graphics("regions.png")
```

Eventually it may be useful to alter the type of region(s), but for now, it seems "regional districts" is the best default type. 

## Suggested data by region

This is a list of the [suggested data](https://github.com/bcgov/housing-data-visualization-project/blob/master/data-sets-list.md), with additional information about granularity (w.r.t. geography and time) and links to the (possibly cleaned) data.

#### BC Stats

* [Population Estimates](http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/PopulationEstimates.aspx) ([sample](data/population.csv))
    * yearly/quarterly for all of BC, yearly for any type of region by sex and age group
* [Population Projections](http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/PopulationProjections.aspx) ([sample](data/population-projections.csv))
    * Same as for population estimates
* [Households](http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/Households.aspx) ([sample](data/households.csv))
  * yearly for any type of region

#### DataBC Catalogue
